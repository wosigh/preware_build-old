PATCH = app-launcher/${NAME}.patch
TITLE = Named Pages in the Launcher
DESCRIPTION = This patch adds a name to each page in the launcher. Hold the Orange key or gesture area and tap the header to rename a page. Tapping on the name header brings up a submenu for navigating directly to any named page. You can also move an app to another page by using a selector in the app's info dialog, summoned via Orange-tap on an app in the launcher. This patch works better with the 'app-launcher-enable-add-delete-pages' and 'app-launcher-gesture-tap-for-info-and-delete' patches, and may conflict with the 'app-launcher-wrap-pages' patch.
