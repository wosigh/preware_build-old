PATCH = contacts/${NAME}.patch
TITLE = Send All Contacts via Email
DESCRIPTION = This patch allows you to create a vCard file containing all your contacts, and then attach that file to an e-mail. WebOS does not offer a built-in way to export your contacts, so this seems to be the next best thing.
CATEGORY = Contacts
VERSIONS = 1.3.1-30 1.3.5-13 1.4.0-2
