PATCH = misc/${NAME}.patch
TITLE = Un-Hardcode TERM
DESCRIPTION = Make TERM=vt100 a default instead of a hard coded absolute in /etc/profile. This way when you ssh in with PuTTY, or from a linux console, or from an xterm-alike, your terminal will 'just work' without you having to manually type TERM=something-appropriate every time you log in.
