PATCH = phone/${NAME}.patch
TITLE = Enable USB Passthrough
DESCRIPTION = This patch does two things:<br/>1) Bypasses the validation screen, so you no longer have to enter a code.<br/>2) Adds the USB Passthrough icon to the launcher, so you no longer have to manually enter ##USBPASS# (or #*#USBPASS#).<br/><br/>This is useful to enable Diagnostics mode for modifications such as enabling standalone GPS.<br/><br/>There are also a couple of interesting modes in USB Passthrough including a GPS mode and USBNet.
