TITLE = TS Charge Alert Fix
DESCRIPTION = This is a workaround for the widely reported problem with some Touchstone docks where the device continuously pops up a 'Charging Battery' alert when the battery reaches 100%.<br /><br />NOTE: This is a workaround, not a complete fix! The root of the problem is faulty Touchstone hardware. You should go to the shop for a replacement. In the meantime, you can apply this patch which will suppress the 'Charging Battery' alert when charging on the Touchstone and battery reaches 100%. The alert will still pop-up normally (i.e. if not charging using Touchstone, or battery not yet at 100%)
