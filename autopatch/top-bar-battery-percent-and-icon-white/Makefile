PATCH = top-bar/${NAME}.patch
TITLE = Battery Percent and Icon White
DESCRIPTION = This is the same as the original Battery percent and Icon patch, except the font will be white instead of the multiple colored.<br/><br/>If you use one of my topbar font patches the numbers and % icon will match the font size and color.<br/><br/>This will not affect the Battery colors, your current Battery icons will be unaffected!<br/><br/>Thanks to nesl247 for the original!
