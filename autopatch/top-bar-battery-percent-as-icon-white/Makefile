TITLE = Battery Percent As Icon White
DESCRIPTION = This is the same as the original Battery Percent as Icon patch, except the % icon will be white instead of multiple colored icons.<br/><br/>If you use one of my topbar font patches the numbers and % icon will match the font size and color.<br/><br/>This will remove and replace your current battery icons with the number and % icon.<br/><br/><b>NOTE:</b>There are no Charging notifications with this patch.<br/><br/>Thanks to nesl247 for the original!
